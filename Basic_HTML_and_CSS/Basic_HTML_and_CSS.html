	<p> This paragraph is to see if the entire paragraph has the colore mentioned in the style
	element. Also, This division of the body will have font Roboto. Got it.</p>
	<p> I am creating another paragraph here. The font in above para should be the same as this.
	Let's run in the browser and see.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<p>Now this para is not in the above division and should look different font but the same color
	since the style is defined for p and will make all paras the same color unless we change it.</p>
	</font></div>
